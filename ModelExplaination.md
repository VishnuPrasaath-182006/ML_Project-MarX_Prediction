# 📊 Logic of the Code

In MarX Prediction, student marks are predicted using a regression-style formula that combines:

🔹Study Hours

 🔹Mode of Study

# Formula

Predicted Marks = Study Hours × Mode Multiplier

# Prediction Rules
Let us divide the Mode of study as

🔹 Normal Study

🔹 Intermediate Study

🔹 Fast study

## 🔵 Normal Mode
Study Pattern: Balanced and consistent learning
Recommended Study Hours: 7–9 hours/day
Multiplier Used: 10

### Prediction Example:
Study Hours = 6
Predicted Marks = 6 × 10 = 60

### Meaning:
Normal mode assumes better focus, revision, and retention.


## 🟠 Intermediate Mode
Study Pattern: Moderate focus with breaks
Recommended Study Hours: 5–7 hours/day
Multiplier Used: 8

### Prediction Example:
Study Hours = 5
Predicted Marks = 5 × 8 = 40

### Meaning:
Performance is good, but not as efficient as Normal mode.

## 🔴 Fast Mode

🔹 Study Pattern: Last-minute or quick study

🔹 Recommended Study Hours: 2–3 hours/day

🔹 Multiplier Used: 5

### Prediction Example:
Study Hours = 3
Predicted Marks = 3 × 5 = 15

### Meaning:
Fast mode results in lower retention and performance.
