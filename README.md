# ML-Project - MarX Prediction
MarX Prediction is a machine learning–based application designed to predict student academic performance using study-related parameters. The system primarily focuses on regression modeling, a core concept of Basic Machine Learning, to estimate student marks based on the number of study hours and the mode of study.

The application allows users to input data for a single student, multiple students, or upload a CSV file containing student study information. Based on the input, the system predicts expected marks, provides personalized recommendations, and presents insights through interactive visualizations.

The project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow including data input, preprocessing, prediction, visualization, and result export, making it a strong example of a Basic ML regression project.

The project is based on Regression - based Prediction
