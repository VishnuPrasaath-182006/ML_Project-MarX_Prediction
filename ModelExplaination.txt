📊 Logic of the Code:-

In MarX Prediction, student marks are predicted using a regression-style formula that combines:
=>Study Hours
=>Mode of Study

Formula:-
Predicted Marks = Study Hours × Mode Multiplier

Prediction Rules
Let us divide the Mode of study as
=> Normal Study
=> Intermediate Study
=> Fast study

🔵 Normal Mode
Study Pattern: Balanced and consistent learning
Recommended Study Hours: 7–9 hours/day
Multiplier Used: 10

Prediction Example:
Study Hours = 6
Predicted Marks = 6 × 10 = 60

Meaning:
Normal mode assumes better focus, revision, and retention.


🟠 Intermediate Mode
Study Pattern: Moderate focus with breaks
Recommended Study Hours: 5–7 hours/day
Multiplier Used: 8

Prediction Example:
Study Hours = 5
Predicted Marks = 5 × 8 = 40

Meaning:
Performance is good, but not as efficient as Normal mode.

🔴 Fast Mode
Study Pattern: Last-minute or quick study
Recommended Study Hours: 2–3 hours/day
Multiplier Used: 5

Prediction Example:
Study Hours = 3
Predicted Marks = 3 × 5 = 15

Meaning:
Fast mode results in lower retention and performance.
